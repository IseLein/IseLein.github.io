			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				I am Computer Science student studying at the University of Toronto. I love technology. 
				I have been a faithful ambassador of the tech buzzwords - artificial intelligence, machine learning,
				cybersecurity, blockchain tech… - you name it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am very passionate about the technological and social infrastructure in the world.
				The way we view the world plays a massive role in how we occupy it. I aspire to lead a career in which I will,
				along with other great minds, seek to understand the best way to frame the modern world hence how best to live in it.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I am not on my laptop or thinking about possible mistakes that could usher us into an apocalypse,
				I could be singing, chatting with friends, or just playing outside.
